# MTGA Deck Checker

A simple python command line program to get your MTG: Arena collection from the log files and check a deck against it.

You must have python and pipenv installed.

```
python --version
// Python 3.7.2
```

```
pip install pipenv
```

After installing both, you must then install all the project dependencies by running this in the folder where the Pipfile is saved

```
pipenv install
```

To run the program in the command line you then simply need to run:

```
pipenv run python deck_check.py
```

If you want to make it an executable, run:

```
pipenv run pyinstaller --onefile deck_check.py
// The output .exe file will be in a folder called dist
```


Example run with deck copied from MTGGoldfish's export to Magic Arena:
